# Embroidery Portfolio

Welcome to my new and improved embroidery portfolio website. Once upon a time I worked as an embroidery artist and as I began to transition into the world of tech the first website I ever built was an online portfolio for my embroidery work using only HTML and CSS.

I thought it would be a fun challenge to redesign and development an entirely new version of this website to see how my skills have improved over time. 

For context this is the [**old version**](https://jenwarman.github.io/PersonalWebsite/)

And this is the [**new version**](https://jenwarman.github.io/PersonalWebsite/)

## Project Objectives

- **UX/UI design:** Design an online portfolio that is not only functional but engaging for the user. 
- **Implement new skills:** An opportunity to use the knowledge from recent online courses in Sass and React.
- **Good feels:** Create a record of my previous work and life as an embroidery artist. 

## Application Features

- **Navigation:** Dynamic vertial navigation with tabs that open to full width across the page. 
- **Gallery:** A scrolling gallery of thumbnail images that expand to full size when clicked. 
- **About Page:** Inclusion of a scroll effect on the about page allowing the text and images to become visible as they enter the view port.
